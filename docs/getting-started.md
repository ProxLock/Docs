# Getting Started with ProxLock

Welcome to ProxLock! This guide will help you get started with securing your API keys using ProxLock's proxy service.

## What is ProxLock?

ProxLock is a secure API proxy service that helps protect your API keys by:
- Splitting your API keys into partial keys that are stored separately
- Proxying API requests through a secure service
- Validating devices using Apple's Device Check framework
- Preventing your full API keys from being exposed in your app

## Quick Start

To get started with ProxLock, you'll need to:

1. **Create a project** in the ProxLock web dashboard
2. **Add your API keys** to the project
3. **Get your credentials** (partial key and association ID)
4. **Set up your iOS app** using the ProxLock iOS SDK
