# ProxLock Documentation

Welcome to the ProxLock documentation! ProxLock helps you secure your API keys by proxying requests through a secure service and splitting your keys for enhanced protection.

## What is ProxLock?

ProxLock is a secure API proxy service designed to protect your API keys in mobile applications. Instead of storing your full API keys in your app, ProxLock:

- **Splits your keys**: Your API keys are split into partial keys stored separately
- **Proxies requests**: All API requests go through ProxLock's secure proxy
- **Validates devices**: Uses Apple's Device Check to ensure requests come from legitimate devices
- **Prevents exposure**: Your full API keys never appear in your app's code
